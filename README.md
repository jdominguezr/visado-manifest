## Which directory should I use for a new plugin configuration

If you are introducing a new plugin configuration, choosing the right directory
in which to store the configuration might look puzzling at first.

To know which directory to use for a new plugin configuration, just go through
the following bullet points from top to bottom.

- Does your plugin configuration need to add Android resources (from a `res` directory) to the container or to add iOS resources to the container ?\
Use `ern_v0.41.1+`

- Does your plugin configuration use `features` directive for Android, `addEmbeddedFramework` directive for iOS, or `applyPatch` directive?\
Use `ern_v0.39.0+`

- Does your plugin configuration use `replaceInFile` directive for Android?\
Use `ern_v0.34.0+`

- Does your plugin configuration use `setBuildSettings` directive for iOS?\
Use `ern_v0.33.0+`

- Does your plugin configuration use `permissions` directive for Android?\
Use `ern_v0.14.0+`

- Otherwise\
Use `ern_v0.13.0+`

Picking the right directory will make sure that your plugin configuration is
made available to the maximum possible range of `ern` client versions, while
guaranteeing that it won't be exposed to incompatible `ern` client versions.
